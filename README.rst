What is it?
===========
``Explain To Me`` is a automatic text summarizer, that utilizes
`TextRank <http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf>`__,
a graph based algorithm to scans through the contents of a website
to extract a concise machine generated summary.
The methodology is similar to the way search engines return
the most relevant web pages from a users search query.

Things to look forward to:
--------------------------
-  Summaries of documents in other languages than English!
